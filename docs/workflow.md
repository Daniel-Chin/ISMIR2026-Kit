# ISMIR MiniConf Workflow

This document describes how this repository works: building the virtual conference website and automating Slack workspace setup for ISMIR.

## What This Repo Is

This is a **fork/adaptation of [MiniConf](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf)** for **ISMIR**. Set the conference local timezone in `sitedata/config.yml` via `timezone: <IANA zone>` (for example `Asia/Dubai`). The committed `sitedata/` still holds the ISMIR 2025 sample dataset. It has two jobs:

1. **Build the virtual conference website** — schedule, papers, posters, LBDs, music, industry sponsors, tutorials, etc.
2. **Automate Slack workspace setup** — create channels, invite people, write channel descriptions with links back to the site.

The site and Slack automation both read from the same **`sitedata/`** CSV/YAML files. Those files are the source of truth. See [Part 3: Data](#part-3-data-sitedata) for file formats, what's committed, dummy setup, and sensitivity notes.

## Part 1: The MiniConf Website (`main.py`)

`main.py` is a **Flask app** that loads everything in `sitedata/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.yml` | Conference metadata, feature flags, calendar colors, Auth0 |
| `papers.csv` | Paper metadata, PDFs, videos, posters, Slack links |
| `events.csv` | Schedule (sessions, tutorials, meetups, etc.) |
| `lbds.csv` | Late-breaking demos |
| `music.csv` | Music program |
| `industry.csv` | Sponsor/industry sessions |

It builds pages like posters (`/poster_<uid>.html`), schedule, tutorials, LBDs, music, and industry. Templates (e.g. `poster.html`) show a **Slack button** when `channel_url` is set.

### Run locally

```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=True FLASK_DEVELOPMENT=True
python main.py
```

### Build and deploy

GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site: [`.github/workflows/refresh-website.yml`](../.github/workflows/refresh-website.yml),
triggered manually or by the Slack `/push-sheet-to-website` command. Paper thumbnails
are cached between runs (see below).

To build the static site locally into `build/` (add `--mockup` to each command for `sitedata_mock/`):

```bash
uv run python pull_from_google_sheet.py
uv run python scripts/download_paper_thumbnails.py
uv run python main.py --build
```

`download_paper_thumbnails.py` downloads each paper's `raw_thumbnail` from Google Drive into
`.cache/drive_thumbnails/`, with `url_map.json` mapping each URL to its file, so a URL is
never requested twice. It copies the needed files into `static/paper_images/`. It pauses
5 minutes when Google rate-limits it, and aborts if any thumbnail is over 1 MB.

---

## Part 2: Data Prep & Slack Automation (`miniconf_prep.py`)

`miniconf_prep.py` is the **orchestrator** for conference setup. Run it with `--action` (add `--mockup` for `sitedata_mock/`):

| Action | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| `setup-papers-create-channels` | Creates public Slack channels from `slack_channel` column |
| `setup-papers-invite-authors` | Invites authors (from `author_emails`) into their paper channels |
| `setup-papers-set-desc` | Sets paper channel topic/purpose with paper metadata and the matching poster-session Slack link |
| `set-event-channel-desc` | Sets description for event rows, including `Poster Session - N`, with the event Zoom/live URL and schedule context |
| `setup-lbd` | LBD poster channels (`lp-*` / `lv-*` naming) |
| `setup-music` | Music performance channels |
| `setup-tutorial-channels` | Generate channel names for Tutorials rows only |
| `create-tutorial-channels` | Create private channels for Tutorials rows with a nonblank `slack_channel`, and write their URLs |
| `setup-tutorials-invite-attendees` | Add active/pending invited registrants to their selected tutorial channels |
| `setup-tutorials` | Compatibility action: create private tutorial channels, then assign attendees |
| `setup-sponsors` | Industry/sponsor channels + invite registered emails |
| `prepare-calendar` | Converts schedule CSV → downloadable ICS |
| `remove-author-email` | Strips private contact info before publishing |
| `process-new-users` | Re-runs tutorial + sponsor invites for new registrations |

Requires `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the environment (loaded from `.env` via `utils/slack.py`).

### Tutorial Slack workflow

### Paper Slack workflow

Follow [Section "Running it" in SLACK.md](./SLACK.md#running-it)

### Channel naming for papers

Defined in `modules/papers.py` — format `p{session}-{position}-{first-3-words-of-title}`:

```python
def title2channelID(title, session_number, paper_number):
    prefix = f"p{session_number}-{paper_number}"
    # title is cleaned, lowercased, truncated to first 3 hyphen-separated parts
    return f"{prefix}-{formatted_title}"
```

Example: `p2-1-reformulating-soft-dynamic`

### Slack utilities (`utils/slack.py`)

- Creating public/private channels (with rate-limit retries)
- Looking up users by email and inviting them
- Writing `https://<workspace>.slack.com/archives/<id>` back into CSV as `channel_url`
- Setting channel topic and purpose

Without `--prod`, dummy emails are used so you can test without spamming real authors.

Full reference — bot app/scope setup, per-step behavior, idempotence, platform limits, troubleshooting — in [SLACK.md](SLACK.md).

### Session announcements (`long_running_bots/announcement_bot.py`)

A bot that automatically posts an announcement when an event starts. See [../long_running_bots/announcement_bot.py](../long_running_bots/announcement_bot.py) and [../long_running_bots/README.md](../long_running_bots/README.md)  

### Self-service website updates (`long_running_bots/self_service_pusher.py`)

The Slack bot listens for `/push-sheet-to-website` and triggers the GitHub workflow. See [setup and token requirements](../long_running_bots/self_service_pusher.py) and [bot operations](../long_running_bots/README.md).

## Part 3: Data (`sitedata/`)

Everything the site and Slack automation need lives under **`sitedata/`**. The Flask app loads all files in that directory at startup; `miniconf_prep.py` reads and writes the same CSVs in place.

### Key columns per file

CSV files. See [./SPREADSHEET_FORMAT.md](./SPREADSHEET_FORMAT.md) for documentation.  
- **`papers.csv`** — one row per accepted paper.
- **`session_assignment.csv`** — source of paper session assignments, times, and chairs.
- **`events.csv`** — schedule entries (tutorials, poster sessions, social events, etc.).
- **`lbds.csv`** — late-breaking demos (similar shape to papers, fewer columns).
- **`music.csv`** — music program performances.
- **`industry.csv`** — sponsor / industry sessions.

Additionally,  
- **`config.yml`** — site-wide settings: conference name/dates, feature toggles (`paper_videos`, `lbd_embeds`, …), calendar color map, Auth0 client ID, release-day controls (`paper_day_release`).

### Session assignments

Edit the `session_assignment` sheet: one session per column, paper UIDs in
`Paper-1`, `Paper-2`, … order. Column order determines session numbers (starting
at 1); session dates determine days (day 1 is the first session’s date). Keep
conference dates and timezone correct in `sitedata/config.yml`. Slack, Zoom, and the catalogue read
assignments from this matrix; every paper must be included.

After pulling the sheet, generate a convenient by-paper view:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.session_assignment
```

This writes `sitedata/session_assignment-by_paper.csv`; paste it into Google
Sheets if useful. It is read-only and does not update the website or Slack.
Zoom and the catalogue use `session_assignment.csv` for paper day, session, and position.

### Importing fresh data

`python pull_from_google_sheet.py` pulls CSVs from the master **Google Sheet** (requires env vars `*_SHEET_URL`):

```bash
export INDUSTRY_SHEET_URL="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<sheet-id>/edit?gid=<tab-gid>#gid=<tab-gid>"
export PAPERS_SHEET_URL=...
export EVENTS_SHEET_URL=...
export MUSIC_SHEET_URL=...
export LBDS_SHEET_URL=...
export SESSION_ASSIGNMENT_SHEET_URL=...

python pull_from_google_sheet.py

# Then rebuild the calendar:
python scripts/calendar_csv2ics.py
```

Typical loop: **update Google Sheet → `python pull_from_google_sheet.py` → run Slack prep → sanitize → commit `sitedata/` → deploy**.

For author-uploaded materials, set `INPUT_PATH` in
[`scripts/parse_google_form_author_uploaded_materials.py`](../scripts/parse_google_form_author_uploaded_materials.py)
to the Google Forms CSV export, then run `python scripts/parse_google_form_author_uploaded_materials.py`.
It updates `raw_poster_pdf`, `raw_thumbnail`, `raw_video`, and `raw_captions` in
`sitedata/papers.csv` with priority: manual edits in `papers.csv` > later submissions >
earlier submissions. A cell holding a value no submission ever had counts as a manual edit
and is kept (so a manual revert to an earlier submitted value violates its assumptions). It also lists papers with no submission. Paste these columns back into the
Google Sheet before the next pull.

For camera-ready paper PDFs, unzip the CMT download and run
`python scripts/camera_ready_pdf_from_cmt_to_google_drive.py <unzipped_dir>`.
It copies each paper's PDF to `tmp/paper_camera_ready/{uid}.pdf` and checks file sizes.
It then asks for the URL of the public Drive folder you upload them to, and fills
`raw_pdf_path` in `sitedata/papers.csv`. Paste that column back into the Google Sheet.

### Data not in the repo

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `.env` / `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Gitignored — required for Slack automation |
| Registration CSV | Tutorials/sponsors expect `__23rd_..._Registration_Data.csv` in `sitedata/` — not committed |
| `jobs.csv` | Referenced by `remove_private_details.py` but not present in current `sitedata/` |
| Master Google Sheet | Source of truth during active conference prep; accessed via `python pull_from_google_sheet.py` |

### Dummy / local setup

**Website only** — works out of the box with committed `sitedata/`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python main.py
# → http://127.0.0.1:10000
```

**Slack dry run** — needs your own workspace and token; omit `--prod` to avoid inviting real authors:

```bash
# .env (gitignored)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
DUMMY_EMAIL=you@your-workspace-email.com   # must be a real user in your test workspace

python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-create-channels
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-invite-authors
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-set-desc
python miniconf_prep.py --action set-event-channel-desc
```

Notes for dummy Slack runs:

- `author_emails` is empty in committed `papers.csv` — invite step only works with `DUMMY_EMAIL` unless you add emails.
- Existing `channel_url` values target ISMIR 2025; clear them (or use a trimmed CSV) when testing in a new workspace.
- Slack caps channel creation at ~90 per run; 111 papers may need two runs.
- `setup-tutorials-invite-attendees` / `setup-tutorials` / `setup-sponsors`
  need a registration CSV supplied with `--registration-csv`; the legacy 2022
  filename under the selected site data directory remains the fallback.


### Sensitivity and publishing

Before committing or deploying, review what is public vs private.

| File | Private columns | Status in committed data |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `papers.csv` | `author_emails`, `primary_email` | Empty |
| `events.csv` | `organiser_emails` | Empty |
| `lbds.csv` | `author_emails`, `primary_email` | Empty |
| `industry.csv` | `registered_emails` | Empty |
| `music.csv` | `author_emails`, `primary_email` | 2 emails in bio HTML |

**Peer reviews** — `papers.csv` includes `review1`–`review4` and `meta_review` text for ~76 papers. This is not email PII, but may be confidential internal content depending on conference policy.

**Public by design** — author names, affiliations, abstracts, Google Drive media links, Slack channel URLs.

**Other** — `config.yml` contains an Auth0 client ID (normally treated as public in OAuth). 

**Sanitize before publish:**

```bash
python miniconf_prep.py --action remove-author-email
```

This runs `scripts/remove_private_details.py`, which drops email columns from all CSVs. Also consider stripping review columns and scrubbing music bios if publishing a scrubbed fork.

**Never commit** — `.env`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, raw registration exports with attendee emails.

## Other Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `scripts/` | Calendar conversion, thumbnail extraction, registration processing, embedding visualization helpers |
| `templates/` + `static/` | MiniConf UI (schedule calendar, paper browser, poster viewer with embedded PDFs/videos) |
| `modules/` | Per-content-type setup logic (papers, LBDs, music, tutorials, industry, zoom) |

---

## End-to-End Workflow for ISMIR

1. **Collect data** in Google Sheets (papers, schedule, LBDs, music, sponsors).
2. **Pull data** with `python pull_from_google_sheet.py` into `sitedata/`.
3. **Run Slack setup** via `miniconf_prep.py` (papers first, then LBDs/music/tutorials/sponsors as needed).
4. **Sanitize** with `remove-author-email` before publishing if emails shouldn't be on the live site.
5. **Build calendar** with `prepare-calendar`.
6. **Preview** locally with `main.py`.
7. **Deploy** by running the `Refresh website` GitHub workflow (or `/push-sheet-to-website` in Slack).

Each paper/poster page gets a Slack link; each Slack channel gets a link back to the MiniConf page — that's the core virtual-conference loop.

## Things to Be Aware Of

- Branding, URLs, and calendar/Zoom timezone are now driven by `sitedata/config.yml` (`timezone: <IANA zone>`); the committed `sitedata/` CSVs are still the 2025 sample dataset (2025 dates, 2025 Slack links). `sitedata/main_calendar.json` was generated with the old Seoul timezone — regenerating it from the 2025 events.csv would shift those times.
- Some older modules (`tutorials.py`, `music.py`, `industry.py`) call Slack helpers with an older API signature (`slackUtils.client` as first arg), while `papers.py` uses the current `utils/slack.py` API. The papers workflow is the most up to date.
- `setup-zoom` is fully wired: one meeting per live session, `join_url` written back to `events.csv`, breakout room per poster for `Poster Session - N` events. Needs Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth creds in `.env`. See [ZOOM.md](ZOOM.md).
- Slack limits channel creation to ~90 per run; large batches may need multiple runs.
