Run with Python 3.12

1. Clone this repo 
2. Run `>> python miniconf_prep.py` this will prepare the data as required by miniconf. Read through this code for the details of preprocessing
3. To build the miniconf site and run it locally try: `>> export FLASK_DEBUG=True; export FLASK_DEVELOPMENT=True; python main.py --path sitedata/`
4. To build the site in production push the committed changes to the `main` branch of remote.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Always pull the latest changes from `main` branch before making any changes.
- Check if there are pull requests (PRs) that are related to your intended changes before starting your work.
- Commit to the `main` branch is allowed, but please try to encompass the feature or bug fix in a single commit.
- If multiple commits are needed, please ensure that each commit does not break the build.
- For major changes that requires time, please work on a separate branch and create a PR to let others know.
    - Have at least one other person review your PR is encouraged but not required.
- Try to keep each PR small and focused on a single issue or feature.
- Merge PRs using __squash and merge__ to keep the commit history clean.


## Paper Slack Channel Setup

See [docs/SLACK.md](docs/SLACK.md) for the full pipeline (app/token setup, what each step does, idempotence, troubleshooting). Short version:

```bash
export SLACK_TOKEN=...

# create channel with the given name, add channel link to the data sheet
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-create-channels --path sitedata/

# the following two orders don't matter
# invite primary authors to their corresponding channel
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-invite-authors --path sitedata/

# add paper-channel metadata, including the poster-session Slack link and miniconf link
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-set-desc --path sitedata/

# set event/channel descriptions for all event rows with link to live Zoom
python miniconf_prep.py --action set-event-channel-desc --path sitedata/
```
