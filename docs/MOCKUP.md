# 3-Hour Mock Conference Runbook

Goal: rehearse the full ISMIR virtual-conference pipeline end to end with **real Slack
and real Zoom** but **fake papers, PDFs, and videos**. Mock inputs live in
`sitedata_mock/` (generated, safe to delete and regenerate); the real 2025 data in
`sitedata/` is untouched.

## The real pipeline (what we are simulating)

Inputs, in the order they arrive during a real conference:

1. **Publication chairs** deliver the accepted-papers table (CSV/JSON export from the
   review system). It carries `uid`, `title`, authors + affiliations, abstract,
   subjects, and author emails.
2. **Program chairs** assign `day`, `session`, `position` per paper — in practice this
   is done in the **master Google Sheet**, which becomes the source of truth.
3. **Authors** supply camera-ready PDF, poster PDF, slides, video (Google Drive
   links added as columns in the sheet).
4. Separate sheet tabs hold **events** (the program), **LBDs**, **music**, and
   **industry/sponsors**; a registration CSV feeds tutorial/sponsor invites.

Flow (each arrow is a script in this repo):

```
Google Sheet ──migrate.sh──▶ sitedata/*.csv
sitedata/events.csv ──prepare-calendar──▶ ICS ──▶ sitedata/main_calendar.json
sitedata/*.csv ──miniconf_prep.py setup-*──▶ Slack channels ──▶ channel_url written back to CSV
sitedata/events.csv ──setup-zoom (utils/zoom.py)──▶ Zoom meetings ──▶ live/zoom links in CSV
sitedata/ ──main.py (Flask)──▶ site preview ──make freeze──▶ static build ──▶ GitHub Pages
```

Outputs: the program website (one page per paper/LBD/performance/sponsor with
embedded PDF + video + "join Slack" button), a Slack workspace with one channel per
item (topic/purpose link back to the site page), Zoom meetings for live sessions,
and the schedule calendar.

See `SPREADSHEET_FORMAT.md` for the exact sheet tabs/columns and `workflow.md`
for the full per-file column reference.

## Mock inputs

`scripts/make_mock_data.py` (run from repo root, no credentials needed):

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/make_mock_data.py
```

Produces:

- `sitedata_mock/papers.csv` — 6 fake papers, all in session 1, day 1, with real-format
  Slack channel names (`p1-1-whale-song-structure`, …), placeholder author emails,
  and media pointing at local fakes.
- `sitedata_mock/events.csv` — the 3-hour program (times use the conference
  timezone configured in `sitedata_mock/config.yml` via
  `timezone: <IANA zone>`; for example `Asia/Dubai`, consumed by
  `scripts/calendar_csv2ics.py`, `main.py:localizetime`, and `utils/zoom.py`).
  Event Slack channel names are
  generated as sanitized title slugs such as `opening-session` or
  `poster-session-1`.

  | 18:00–18:10 | Opening | 19:45–20:10 | LBD Session |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 18:10–18:30 | Mock Tutorial | 20:10–20:30 | Industry Session |
  | 18:30–19:00 | Oral Session 1 | 20:30–20:50 | Music Program |
  | 19:00–19:45 | Poster Session 1 | 20:50–21:00 | Closing & Awards |

  Days 2–5 get one filler event each because `main.py:group_by_days` hard-requires
  days 1–5.
- `mock_inputs/tutorial_registration.csv` — one fake attendee selection for
  rehearsing the staged tutorial Slack workflow. It deliberately lives outside
  `sitedata_mock/` so Flask does not publish attendee data as JSON.
- `sitedata_mock/lbds.csv` (2), `music.csv` (1, includes the `bb_id` column that
  `format_music` needs), `industry.csv` (2 sponsors).
- `sitedata_mock/config.yml` — copy of `sitedata/config.yml` renamed "ISMIR 2026 Mock Run",
  with `paper_day_release`/`lbd_day_release` set to 1 so everything is visible.
- `static/mock/*.pdf` — generated one-page placeholder PDFs (paper/poster/slides per
  paper, LBD abstracts, sponsor decks).
- Fake videos: every `video`/`youtube_id`/`yt_id` points at the CC-licensed
  Big Buck Bunny YouTube ID `aqz-KE-bpKQ`.
- `sitedata_mock/main_calendar.json` + `static/calendar/ISMIR_2026.ics` — built with
  the real `prepare-calendar` scripts (same ICS filename `main.py`'s `/getCalendar`
  download route serves).

## Mock Google Drive + master sheet

The 22 placeholder PDFs live in a real Drive folder:
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-0LdWqhrLIaJ9PsG7uhAN7As8LXAFPXk>
(file IDs in `scripts/mock_drive_ids.json`). Files carry `anyone: reader`
permission — embeds work without login (verified).

The same folder holds five **Google Sheets** named `papers`, `events`, `lbds`,
`music`, `industry` (IDs under `sheets` in `scripts/mock_drive_ids.json`),
pre-filled with the mock data and real Drive media links (`raw_* = open?id=...`,
embed columns = `/file/d/<id>/preview`). The real conference uses one sheet
with 5 tabs; the mock uses 5 single-tab sheets because they were created via
the Drive API, which can't add tabs — the CSV-export mechanism is identical.

**`./migrate_mock.sh`** plays the role of `migrate.sh`: pulls all five sheets
into `sitedata_mock/*.csv` via unauthenticated export URLs and rebuilds the
calendar. Verified end-to-end: edit sheet → `./migrate_mock.sh` →
`python main.py --path sitedata_mock/` → poster pages embed the Drive PDFs.

If you prefer the literal single-sheet setup, `scripts/make_sheet_export.py`
writes paste-ready **TSVs** to `sheet_export/` — paste each into a tab of one
sheet (cell A1; TSV splits into columns on paste, CSV does not) and use the
original `migrate.sh` with that sheet's ID + tab gids.

Videos stay YouTube (`aqz-KE-bpKQ`) — the video columns accept any iframe URL,
and LBD/music use YouTube IDs anyway.

## Rehearsal steps

### 1. Website (no credentials) — verified working

```bash
.venv/bin/python main.py --path sitedata_mock/
# → http://127.0.0.1:10000  (calendar, papers, poster_1..6, lbds, music_1, industry, day_1)
```

### 2. Slack (real workspace, needs setup)

Full Slack reference in [SLACK.md](SLACK.md).

One-time: create a free test Slack workspace, create a Slack app with bot scopes
`channels:manage`, `channels:read`, `groups:write`, `chat:write`, `users:read`,
`users:read.email`, install it, and put in `.env` (gitignored):

```
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...
DUMMY_EMAIL=<your-email-in-that-workspace>   # invites go here in non-prod mode
```

Create and populate the paper channels:

```bash
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-create-channels --path sitedata_mock/
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-invite-authors  --path sitedata_mock/   # non-prod → invites DUMMY_EMAIL
python miniconf_prep.py --action setup-papers-set-desc        --path sitedata_mock/
```

Rehearse the staged tutorial workflow with the included fake registration:

```bash
python miniconf_prep.py \
  --path sitedata_mock/ \
  --action setup-tutorials-create-channels

# Manually make #announcements and #help permanent defaults and
# #tutorial-reproducible-mir a temporary default, then:
python miniconf_prep.py \
  --path sitedata_mock/ \
  --registration-csv mock_inputs/tutorial_registration.csv \
  --action setup-tutorials-invite-attendees
```

In non-production mode the second command assigns `DUMMY_EMAIL`, not the fake
registration address. Then remove only the tutorial channel from Slack
defaults, audit its membership, and convert it to private. Keep
`#announcements` and `#help` public and default.

`create-channels` writes `channel_url` back into the CSV → restart `main.py` and the
poster pages grow a working "Slack" button. `setup-papers-set-desc` now applies
the poster flow end-to-end: it sets each `poster-session-*` channel purpose to
that session's Zoom URL (the one with breakout rooms), and sets each paper
channel purpose to include a within-Slack link to the corresponding
poster-session channel. The paper purpose also includes the program-site link;
the base URL defaults to `https://ismir2026program.ismir.net` and can be
overridden with `SITE_BASE_URL`.

LBD/music/tutorial/sponsor channel setup (`setup-lbd`, `setup-music`, …) uses
the same pipeline but is less exercised than the papers path; papers are the
representative test.

### 3. Zoom (real account, needs setup)

Full reference: [ZOOM.md](ZOOM.md) (app creation, scopes, API surface, troubleshooting).

Create a Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth app, add to `.env`:

```
accountId=...
clientId=...
clientSecret=...
```

The `setup-zoom` action is fully wired:

```bash
.venv/bin/python miniconf_prep.py --path sitedata_mock --action setup-zoom             # dry-run, no API calls
.venv/bin/python miniconf_prep.py --path sitedata_mock --action setup-zoom --prod true # creates meetings
```

`ZoomCreator` skips the `Tutorials`/`Lunch`/`Social` categories (the mock buffer
days are `Social`, so the 3-hour program yields 7 meetings). Events titled
`Poster Session - N` additionally get one pre-created **breakout room per poster**
(papers matched on `day` + `session` in `papers.csv`, rooms named after the
paper's Slack channel, e.g. `p1-1-whale-song-structure`) — after the poster
craze the host opens the rooms and each poster gets its own. Rooms are patched
onto the meeting even when the link is only backfilled, so meetings created
before a papers-sheet update pick up the rooms on re-run. Zoom caps pre-created
rooms at 50/meeting and names at 32 chars. `ZoomCreator` calls
`utils/zoom.py:createZoomLinksIfNeeded`, which creates one meeting per remaining
row and writes the `join_url` into `live_url` in `events.csv`. It is idempotent
by meeting topic: rows whose title already has a Zoom meeting get the existing
URL backfilled instead of a duplicate — so when `./migrate_mock.sh` re-pulls the
sheet and wipes `live_url`, re-running `setup-zoom` restores the links (copy them
back into the events sheet if the sheet should stay authoritative). Meeting start
times are interpreted in the timezone configured in
`sitedata_mock/config.yml` and durations come from `start_time`/`end_time`.
Breakout rooms are
verified by reading the meeting back after create/patch — if the account's
breakout-room setting is off, the run fails loudly instead of silently creating
room-less meetings. Caveat: free Zoom accounts cap meetings at 40 min.

### 4. Run the 3 hours

- T-0:15 — start site (or `make freeze` + deploy), post welcome in Slack `#general`.
- 18:10 — run the mock tutorial and verify its page and private Slack channel.
- 18:30 — open the Oral Session Zoom from the calendar's `live_url`.
- 19:00 — poster session: Q&A happens in the per-paper channels (`p1-1-…` … `p1-6-…`).
- 20:10/20:30 — sponsor + music pages with embedded fake PDF/video.
- Debrief: check `channel_url` round-trip, calendar links, timezone rendering.

## What still needs a human

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Slack workspace + bot token in `.env` | credentials |
| Zoom S2S OAuth creds in `.env` | credentials |
| Real author emails + `--prod` flag | only for the real event, never for tests |
| Sponsor registration CSV (`setup-sponsors`) | not part of the 3-hour mock; a fake tutorial registration is included |
